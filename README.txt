Readme File for Umang Methi, Steven Hewitt, and Eugene Kim



Our group decided to split up the Front End work so we could efficiently complete all the components. We chose to use HTML, CSS, and Javascript to code all the different aspects such as the Visual Rubik's Cube, Graphics, and Algorithm. 

Umang worked on the index.html file and incorporated different images and graphics and the high scores table. 

Steven worked on rendering the Rubik's Cube by using Javascript. 

Eugene worked on the algorithm to determine how the cube's faces would change after different moves. 

At around 8 PM, Eugene and Steven collaborated to incorporate both the cube visual and the algorithm. We finished this around 9 PM and then we spent the rest of our time integrating the index page with the Rubik's Cube coding and figuring out how to submit our code to the GitHub link. 

Instead of just focusing on the Front End, our group kind of combined it with some Back-End because we also implemented an algorithm that shows how the cube changes after different moves. Our index page contains images of a traditional Rubik's Cube, a basic description of a Rubik's Cube for users who don't know what it is, the visual game itself where the users can try and compete against the fastest times, and lastly, a visual representation of the top Rubik's cube times. Additionally, if the user wants some inspiration, we have video links to these record times. 

Overall, our group functioned very well together and we like our finished product :) 

Things we could've done had we had more time:

render page properly
make it pretttyyyyyy ;)
make more DRY
make reset button functionality actually work
